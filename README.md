Uplift to Node 16.9 from older version of my JsGangOfFour written about the time of Node 5.

To run this app.

Once that is done.

Open the folder for the code in VSCODE.

Then open the VSCODE Terminal window.

Once in the terminal window.

Run **npm install**

Once nodeman starts up the app you can click on the link in the terminal to bring up the website in your default browser.
