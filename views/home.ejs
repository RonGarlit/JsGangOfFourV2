      <p class="lead">This is an implementation of the Classic "Gang of Four" design patterns in JavaScript.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The body of code provided here is my playground. My intent is multi-purpose.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First is to brush up on my JavaScript.</li>
        <li>Move from my core Microsoft .NET mindset to a open source Node JS one.</li>
        <li>As a software architect, where better to start than with the basic design patterns?</li>
        <li>An with that in mind I wanted to also use this code for a user group presentation.</li>
        <li>Plus I wanted to uplift my Bootstrap skills from Version 3 to 4.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The design patterns discussed here are based on the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software".</p>
      <p>Written somewhere around 1997 this book is the classic text for software engineering book describing software design
        patterns. Currently a copy of the book in PDF form can be found here:
        <a href="http://www.uml.org.cn/c%2B%2B/pdf/DesignPatterns.pdf">Design Patterns PDF</a>
      </p>
      <p>For us old salty developers and architects it is known as the "Gang Of Four" design patterns. Which is a tribute to
        the book's authors, Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides.</p>
      <p>The basic 23 classic design patterns are grouped into creational, structural and behavioral patterns. Which you can
        view under their respecitive menus above which I've demonstrated in JavaScript rather than in C or C#.</p>

        <p>Additionally I'd like to credit the learnings of
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-poorte-85a23a/" rel="nofollow">Jack Poorte</a>, Founder of
          <a href="https://www.dofactory.com/" rel="nofollow">Data Object Factory</a>, whose many architectual instructional courses I've taken since 2008.</p>

        <p>In 2013 Jack published a course called
          <a href="https://www.dofactory.com/products/javascript-jquery-design-pattern-framework" rel="nofollow">"JavaScript + jQuery Design Pattern Framework"</a>
          and the teachings from that course in 2013 is reflected in this project.
